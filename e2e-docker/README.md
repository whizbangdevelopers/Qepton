# 1. Setup (first time only)
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Run all tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh

# 3. View report
open output/reports/index.html

## Available Commands

### Run All Tests

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

Runs the complete E2E test suite with 4 parallel workers.

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
./scripts/run-single.sh tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts
./scripts/run-single.sh tests/e2e/gists.spec.ts
```

### Interactive UI Mode

```bash
./scripts/run-ui.sh
```

Opens Playwright's interactive UI at http://localhost:9323

### Watch Mode

```bash
cd e2e-docker
docker-compose --profile watch up
```

Re-runs tests automatically on file changes.

### Debug Mode

```bash
cd e2e-docker
docker-compose --profile debug up
```

Runs with `PWDEBUG=1` for step-through debugging.

## Docker Compose Profiles

| Profile   | Description                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| (default) | Run all tests once           |
| `watch`   | Re-run on file changes       |
| `ui`      | Interactive Playwright UI    |
| `debug`   | Step-through debugging       |
| `dev`     | Start Quasar dev server only |
| `single`  | Run single test file         |

## Environment Variables

| Variable            | Description                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_TEST_TOKEN` | GitHub token for real API tests     |
| `TEST_FILE`         | Test file path (for single profile) |
| `CI`                | Set to `true` for CI environment    |

### Using Real GitHub API

```bash
export GITHUB_TEST_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Test Reports

After running tests, reports are available at:

| Report       | Path                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| HTML Report  | `output/reports/index.html`       |
| JSON Results | `output/test-results/`            |
| Screenshots  | `output/reports/` (on failure)    |
| Videos       | `output/reports/` (on failure)    |
| Traces       | `output/test-results/*/trace.zip` |

## Playwright MCP Integration

The project includes Playwright MCP server configuration in `.mcp.json` for Claude Code integration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--browser", "chromium"]
    }
  }
}
```

This enables Claude to interact with the browser for automated testing workflows.

## Test Coverage

| Category       | Tests | Description          |
| -------------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| Authentication | 9     | Login/logout flows   |
| Gists          | 30+   | CRUD operations      |
| Search         | 14    | Search functionality |
| Tags           | 17    | Tag management       |
| Keyboard       | 17    | Shortcut handling    |
| UI Modes       | 20+   | Theme, dashboard     |
| Rendering      | 10+   | Code display         |

**Total: 109 tests** across 7 test files

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Build Fails

```bash
# Clear Docker cache and rebuild
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Tests Timeout

```bash
# Increase timeout in docker-compose.yml or run fewer workers
docker-compose run playwright-tests npx playwright test --workers=1
```

### Network Issues

The container uses `network_mode: host` to access localhost services. Ensure port 9000 is available for the Quasar dev server.

### View Failed Test Details

```bash
# Open trace for debugging
npx playwright show-trace output/test-results/*/trace.zip
```

## System Requirements

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- 4GB RAM minimum
- 5GB disk space (for browsers)
