## Issue Organization

**Dev repo is the single source of truth for all development work.**

- **Free repo** contains only user-facing feature requests (from README)
- **Dev repo** contains ALL development work with prefixes indicating target:
  - `[Free]` - Work targeting Free repo (infrastructure, marketing, features)
  - `[Premium]` - Work targeting Premium repo
  - `[Plugin]` - Work targeting Plugin ecosystem
- Labels: `free-infra`, `premium`, `plugin` for filtering
