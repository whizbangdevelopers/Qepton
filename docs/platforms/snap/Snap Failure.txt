Why the current build likely fails:
The existing release.yml installs snapcraft but electron-builder's snap building in GitHub Actions often fails because it needs LXD/Multipass for proper confinement testing. The new workflow uses snapcore/action-build which handles this automatically.
Quick start:
bash# 1. Register the snap name (one time)
snapcraft login
snapcraft register qepton

# 2. Generate credentials for GitHub
snapcraft export-login --snaps=qepton --channels=edge,stable credentials.txt

# 3. Add to GitHub: Settings → Secrets → SNAPCRAFT_STORE_CREDENTIALS
#    (paste contents of credentials.txt)

# 4. Push a tag to trigger the build
git add .
git commit -m "Add snap store publishing"
git tag v1.0.12
git push origin main --tags
The workflow will automatically publish to the edge channel on tagged releases. You can then promote to stable via the Snapcraft dashboard or by manually triggering the workflow.
