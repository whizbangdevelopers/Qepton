### 6. Bulk Operations

- [ ] Select all / Deselect all

---

### 7. Keyboard Shortcuts

### 9. Persistence & Cross-Device Sync

| Feature           | Approach               | Status         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Local preferences | localStorage via Pinia | ✅ Implemented |
| Cross-device sync | Private GitHub Gist    | ✅ Implemented |
| Team workspaces   | Backend required       | 🔲 Future      |
| Offline caching   | SQLite                 | 🔲 Future      |

**Current Implementation:**

- [x] Settings synced via private `.qepton-settings.json` gist
- [x] Synced settings: pinned tags, recent gists, saved searches, UI preferences
- [x] Debounced writes (2s) to minimize API calls
- [x] Works across Electron, PWA, and mobile (Capacitor)

**Future Considerations:**

- **Team workspaces**: Would require Supabase/Firebase or custom backend
- **Offline-first**: SQLite for local caching of gist content when teams are added
